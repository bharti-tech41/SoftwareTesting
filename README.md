Learning Software testing tools and activities

Software Testing is a crucial process in software development, aiming to ensure that the software meets the required standards and functions as expected. It involves the evaluation of software by executing it in a controlled environment to detect defects, bugs, or issues. The goal is to identify any flaws before the software is released to the end users, thereby improving its quality, reliability, and performance.

Types of Software Testing

Manual Testing:

Testing is performed manually by a human without the assistance of automated tools. Testers execute test cases, document the results, and compare them with expected outcomes.

Automated Testing:

Testing is performed using automated tools that execute pre-scripted tests on the software. It is faster, more reliable, and can cover more test cases than manual testing.

Unit Testing:

Testing individual components or units of software to ensure they function correctly. Typically done by developers during the development phase.
